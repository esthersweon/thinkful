It also uses vague and highly connotative wording (\"worst job of representing\") that pits the media against President Trump – this presumes then that the media is misrepresenting or slandering President Trump, which will trigger many Trump supporters.

In general, this survey is clearly geared towards affirming existing beliefs in Trump supporters, vs. actually getting unbiased feedback from a diverse sample of people.
