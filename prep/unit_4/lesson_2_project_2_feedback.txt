CAPSTONE PROJECT FEEDBACK





FROM MENTOR
- Scatterplot - numerical vs numerical variables
- Do all relationships (total victims vs total policemen)
Histograms
- One continuous numerical value
- Counting frequency of that one value
- Frequency of age or height in population 
Bar plots
- Categorical vs numerical
- Group by date (month)

Box plot
- Similar to histogram
- Visualizing data at that

Line plot 
- Over time 

CLEAN age - 0
Distribution of age – histogram
Hard to see outliers in histogram(???)

Comparative plots
i.e. histogram of male fatalities
Vs histogram of female fatalities 

Females / males - be transparent about dropping m/f vs unknown

Cause of mass shooting by mentally ill or not
- 2 bars – mentally ill and not for each cause

QUESTIONS
- Drop null
- 
- Don’t have describe

Employed vs coworkers 
- Interesting that there are more employed
- Of employed, try to find top causes

        4. Shooters’ gender wise comparison of (use box plots: Refer to df.groupby('Sex').boxplot(column=attribute, by='Period’) in http://www.alexsalo.xyz/pretty-boxplots-python-matplotlib-pandas-seaborn/). These can be done much more easily using seaborn that we’ll be learning about in the bootcamp course:
                - Fatalities
                - Total victims
                - Policemen killed
                - Ages

Remember: Box plots - show ranges/outliers, bar plots - categorical variables who have continuous values, histogram - shows the distribution of a continuous variable





FROM CAPSTONE REVIEWER

- Ratio of each race to population in US
- Ratio of each race in different populations / cities throughout the country

- Normalize by state population to see if # of shootings is unique 

- Difficult to normalize male vs female causes for mass shootings bc not enough females across all causes (around 5 females per category – for the least popular category; other categories will likely have more)

- For last visualization: Could compare face values with ratio (white shooters vs # of white people in city / US, etc.)

INCLUDE STATISTICS - NOT JUST VISUALS / CONCLUSIONS

FOR FATALITY - VICTIM GRAPH
2 sample kstest

FOR MENTALLY ILL VS NOT ILL GRAPH
PEARSON CHI-SQUARE TEST

IS AVERAGE AGE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES 
- T - TEST - 2 NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
- E.G. 2 causes are your 2 normal distributions… see if ages (mean of distribution) are significantly different (t-value)


Takeaways: 
- Add statistics to back up your conclusions
- Add more visualizations
    - ADD Venn diagram
    - ADD MAP, MAYBE SCATTER PLOT / CONTINUOUS DATA
