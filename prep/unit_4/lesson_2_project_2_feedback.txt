CAPSTONE PROJECT FEEDBACK

- Ratio of each race to population in US
- Ratio of each race in different populations / cities throughout the country

- Normalize by state population to see if # of shootings is unique 

- Difficult to normalize male vs female causes for mass shootings bc not enough females across all causes (around 5 females per category – for the least popular category; other categories will likely have more)

- For last visualization: Could compare face values with ratio (white shooters vs # of white people in city / US, etc.)

INCLUDE STATISTICS - NOT JUST VISUALS / CONCLUSIONS

FOR FATALITY - VICTIM GRAPH
2 sample kstest

FOR MENTALLY ILL VS NOT ILL GRAPH
PEARSON CHI-SQUARE TEST

IS AVERAGE AGE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES 
- T - TEST - 2 NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
- E.G. 2 causes are your 2 normal distributions… see if ages (mean of distribution) are significantly different (t-value)


Takeaways: 
- Add statistics to back up your conclusions
- Add more visualizations
    - ADD Venn diagram
    - ADD MAP, MAYBE SCATTER PLOT / CONTINUOUS DATA
